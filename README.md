# Password Generator

## Description
This is a challenge I did for my bootcamp. I was tasked to complete the password generator using the starter code provided to me by the course. I utalised the knowledge I learnt over the last couple of weeks alongside some research and questions to friends and peers to help me achieve my final code. On occasions where I had exhausted every option I could think of, I used AI to point me in the right direction.
